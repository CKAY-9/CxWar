A personal plugin used on my own server. Doesn't offer too much customizability but is a good starting point if you want a similar plugin.

## Features

### Commands
- `/reveal [target]`: Reveal a target's location with a cooldown
- `/hidden [start/end] [diamond/netherite]`: Protect yourself from reveals using diamonds and netherite
- `/group [create/join/invite/delete/leave] [name]`: Create, join, leave, etc., groups

### Websocket Server
